# Spaces with SDL

This is a testing project playing with [sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) go port. The game is based in a component architecture where every entity in the game is an element based on several components.

The game is a space invader copy with bees. The spaceship must destroy all the bees to win ðŸ™‚.
